# password_generator
Generates a complex password of 20 random characters

This is a simple project to reinforce basic syntax skills and promote password security best practices. Although I utilized two YouTube tutorials for inspiration and tips (thank you to NeuralNine https://youtu.be/rHTwjV1ORUQ and to TechWithTim https://youtu.be/XCIBOl3FTKo), I wanted to build this simple program on my own. 

I started by importing libraries, generating all possible characters, combining all of those into one variable (for iteration), then proceeded with my function. The function would generate a random password using iteration and a While loop, then reverse the string result for added complexity at the end. 

Further modifications to this program could include prompting the user for a password length (while fitting better security standard practices using logic).




Feedback welcome! Thank you.
